# NeoTweakBar

Minimalistic C++ GUI library with panels and widgets to allow easy tweaking of variables and parameters
on-the-fly by games and real-time rendering applications. Inspired by [AntTweakBar](http://anttweakbar.sourceforge.net/doc/),
but not tied to any specific graphics API or Operating System.

This was a work in progress, but I'm unlikely to finish this project any time soon. For other better options on lightweight UI
libraries for C++ and C check out [ImGUI](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui), [NanoGUI](https://github.com/wjakob/nanogui) and [Nuklear](https://github.com/vurtun/nuklear).
