# NeoTweakBar

A tiny C++ GUI library with panels and widgets to allow easy tweaking of variables and parameters
on-the-fly in games and real-time rendering applications. Inspired by [AntTweakBar](http://anttweakbar.sourceforge.net/doc/),
but not tied to any specific graphics API or Operating System.

Work in progress. Check back again soon...
